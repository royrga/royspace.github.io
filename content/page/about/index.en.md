I am interested in science, technology, and humanities, such as art, society, and politics.

I studied automation engineering, and since then, my focus has been on programming in C, Python, Java, Kotlin, typing, and processing.
I enjoy learning digital tools that allow me to create artistic expressions.

I also play the guitar and take photos.

As for practical sports, I play squash and go cycling.
